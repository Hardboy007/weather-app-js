# 🌤 Weather App (JavaScript)

A clean and interactive **Weather Application** built using **HTML, CSS & JavaScript**.  
It fetches real-time weather data using the **Visual Crossing Weather API** and updates the UI dynamically based on weather conditions.

## 🚀 Features
- Search weather by city name (supports Enter key and Search button)
- Displays current temperature and weather condition
- Dynamic background changes based on weather (Clear / Rain / Cloudy)
- Loading indicator while fetching data
- Error handling for invalid city names
- Responsive and clean UI design

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – Semantic markup
- **CSS3** – Flexbox, Grid, gradients, polished UI
- **JavaScript** – DOM manipulation, Fetch API, async handling
- **API** – Visual Crossing Weather API (free plan)

## 💡 What I Learned
- Working with APIs and asynchronous JavaScript
- Handling errors and loading states
- DOM manipulation and dynamic UI updates
- Mapping API data to UI elements
- Basic responsive design for better user experience

---

## 🔗 Future Improvements
- Add weather icons corresponding to conditions
- Animate transitions for temperature/condition changes
- Hide API key using backend (security best practice)
- Add current location weather using Geolocation API

---

## ⚠️ Note
This project uses a **free API key**, which has daily request limits.  
If API quota exceeds, data may not load until the limit resets.
